In "How to Become a Hacker," Eric Raymond describes Lisp as something like Latin or Greek â€” 
a language you should learn as an intellectual exercise, even though you won't actually use it:

    Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that 
	experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, 
	even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot. 

-- Paul Graham
